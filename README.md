In summer, I tried to use my laptop running Archlinux 
without being able to go on the internet at all;
Running a Core ONLY install was hard. 
Using only my own programs to monitor battery and create
my own visual interfaces was fun. 
This project was so i'd learn C and C++.

Here is a repository of all the code i've written in this adventure.
